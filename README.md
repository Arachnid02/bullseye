# bullseye
bullseye.py will create multiple bull's eyes with at least four different colors. The rings of the bullseye will be different sizes with different numbers of rings each time you run it. Bullseye will be able to take user input into account when creating the bull's eye, and will be protected from bad user input. bullseye.py will utilize custom programmer defined functions and the randomint() function in order to efficiently meet the requirements listed above.
